# DefendTheMonument

## Ideas 
_These are actual ideas, they may or may not be added._

- **REQUIRES DATAMOD** - Units from Dark Age with focus walls over units (like rams)?
- Petard with less blast damage in Dark Age
- Instantly delete all p8 buildings in center (delete converted buildings)
  - Maybe filter potential buildings p8 might eventually get in map generation?
- Don't remove trees and don't remove elevation
  - Find proper spot for villagers (do same for boars) etc.
  - Look around vill spawn area for valid spot (Maybe use gridmap somehow?)
